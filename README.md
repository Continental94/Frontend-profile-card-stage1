# Frontend Stage 2: Multi-Framework Ticket Web App

This project implements a fully functional, secure Ticket Management application built across three different frontend frameworks: React, Vue, and Twig/Vanilla JavaScript.

## Core Compliance Statement

All three applications were engineered to share the exact same CSS (`style.css`) and HTML class structure. This ensures perfect visual and layout consistency (e.g., max-width: 1440px, wavy hero, card styling) across all three required technologies.

## Implementations and Documentation

Please refer to the following folders for specific setup instructions and architectural details for each implementation.

* [React Implementation](react-app/README.md)
* [Vue Implementation](vue-app/README.md)
* [Twig/Vanilla JS Implementation](twig-app/README.md)

### Security Credentials (MANDATORY)

To test the Login and Protected Route functionality in all three apps:

| Field | Value |
| Username | `test` |
| Password | `password` |
